            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>I am SpindesZeroMB, FGE SpindesZeroMB, previously known as FRC SpindesZeroMB. Most people simply call me Spindes. My real name is Milan, in case you'd like to know. I am 17 years old now and will be turning 18 in a few months.

                My sim racing career began when I was 12 years old. Before that, I wasn't really into Formula 1 or racing at all until my uncle introduced me to it. After that, I started learning about sim racing, and I really wanted to try it for fun. However, at the age of 12, I had no money to pursue it. Around that time, my mother was battling cancer. She saw me playing the F1 game on a controller and wanted to buy me a steering wheel as a special gift before she passed away. Unfortunately, her condition worsened rapidly, and we had other things to focus on.
                
                Then, on December 6, 2019, the worst day of my life happened—my mother passed away. Cancer won. After her passing, we lived with my grandmother for a few weeks. She herself had just survived cancer a few months earlier. One day, my grandmother said to me, "Let's buy you the wheel; it’s the last present from your mother." That gesture helped me through the hardest period of my life.
                
                A few weeks later, we moved in with my dad in a completely different city. I didn’t know anyone there, and the only thing I had was my wheel. I kept playing the F1 game over and over again until I improved. Believe me, I was terrible at F1 2020 at first. But I had the best motivation anyone could ask for—I wanted to make my mother and grandmother proud. They are the reason I am still racing and why I will never stop chasing my dream. I will always race for them. I never feel alone on the track because I know my mother is watching over me while I race. My grandmother, who I am so lucky to still have, continues to support me every step of the way.
                
                For me, racing holds more than one meaning. I will always do my best, even when things aren’t going well, because my motivation comes from the deepest parts of my heart.
            
                                                                    Ik hou van je mama ♥</p>
